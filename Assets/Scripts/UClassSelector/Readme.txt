1. Add Example Script to GameObject:

In Unity, create an empty GameObject or use an existing one.
Attach the UClassSelectorExample script to the GameObject by dragging it onto the GameObject in the Inspector or by using the "Add Component" button.


2. Select a Class in the Inspector:

With the GameObject selected, you will see the UClassSelectorExample component in the Inspector.
You should see a dropdown menu labeled "Selected U Class" that lists all classes derived from MonoBehaviour.
Select a class from the dropdown list.

3. Run the Scene:

When you play the scene, the UClassSelectorExample script will add the selected class as a component to the GameObject.
